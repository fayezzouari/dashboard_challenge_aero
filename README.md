# Aerobotix Birthday Challenge Platform

Welcome to the **Aerobotix Birthday Challenge Platform**, an application developed to host competitive robotics challenges. This platform was used for the **Aerobotix Birthday Challenge**, an 8-hour event that brought together teams to solve a series of problems under a competitive setting. 

The platform is built using **Next.js** and **shadcn/ui components**, offering a robust and dynamic user experience for both participants and administrators. It remains live, and you can view the problems [here](https://dashboard-challenge-aero.vercel.app/view-problems).
